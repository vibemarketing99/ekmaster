# Skills Overview

> **Purpose:** Reference document for all available skills that can be invoked during development. Skills are reusable capabilities that provide structured guidance for specific tasks.

---

## How to Use Skills

Skills are invoked using the Skill tool before starting specific types of work:

```
Use the Skill tool to invoke [skill-name] before starting [task type]
```

## Creating Custom Skills

When encountering specialized or repetitive tasks, consider creating a custom skill.

**When to Create a Skill:**
- Repeating same workflow across multiple projects
- Task requires specialized domain knowledge
- Want to codify best practices
- Need consistency in task execution

**Skill Creation Workflow:**
1. Identify the task/workflow that would benefit
2. Document steps, requirements, expected outcomes
3. Use skill-creation tooling to structure properly
4. Test on real use cases
5. Iterate and refine based on usage

**After Creating a Skill:**
1. Add it to this document
2. Update the skill table in Claude.md
3. Document trigger conditions

---

## Skill Template

When documenting a new skill, use this template:

```markdown
### [Skill Name]

**Invocation:** `[skill-invocation-name]`

**Purpose:** [One-line description]

**When to Use:**
- [Trigger condition 1]
- [Trigger condition 2]
- [Trigger condition 3]

**Capabilities:**
- [Capability 1]
- [Capability 2]

**Actions Supported:**
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

**Documentation:** [Link or reference to full docs]
```

## Custom Skills Registry

Add custom skills here as they are created:

| Skill Name | Purpose | Trigger |
|------------|---------|---------|
| *(Add custom skills here)* | | |

---

## Best Practices

1. **Always invoke required skills** before starting work - don't skip even for "simple" tasks
2. **Check skill applicability** at the start of every task
3. **Combine skills** when appropriate (e.g., planning-with-files + ui-ux-pro-max for frontend projects)
4. **Document new skills** in this file when created
5. **Review skill triggers** regularly to ensure correct usage
6. **Create skills proactively** for repetitive specialized work

---

## Skill Invocation Checklist

Before starting any task, ask:

- [ ] Does this task require planning? → Invoke `planning-with-files`
- [ ] Is this frontend/UI work? → Invoke `ui-ux-pro-max`
- [ ] Are there custom skills that apply? → Check Custom Skills Registry
- [ ] Should I create a new skill for this task type? → Consider if repetitive/specialized
