# User Personas – [Project Name]

> **Purpose**  
> This document defines the canonical user personas used to drive **all product, UX, and prototype decisions** across mobile and desktop.  
> If a behavior, constraint, or decision is not represented here, it must not influence the build.

> **Rules**
> - All sections are mandatory
> - Personas are behavior-driven, not demographic fiction
> - Features must justify themselves against personas or be cut
> - This file is the single source of truth for user reality

## Persona 1: [Name / Archetype]

### Background
- Role / Job:
- Age / Demographics:
- Technical Proficiency: Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
- Domain Knowledge:
- Context (why they are here at all):

---

### Usage Environment
- Primary Device: Mobile / Desktop
- Secondary Device:
- Typical Context (on-the-go, desk, couch, mixed):
- Average Session Length:
- Interrupt Frequency: Low / Medium / High
- Input Constraints (one-handed, keyboard-heavy, precision):

---

### Behavioral Traits
- Usage Frequency: Daily / Weekly / Episodic
- Learning Style: Guided / Exploratory
- Error Tolerance: Low / Medium / High
- Speed vs Precision Bias:
- Risk Profile (conservative / neutral / aggressive):

---

### Goals
- Primary Goal:
- Secondary Goals:
- Success Metrics (observable signals, not feelings):

---

### Pain Points
- Primary Pain:
- Secondary Pain:
- Current Workarounds:
- Frustrations:

---

### Failure Definition
- What failure looks like:
- Most likely abandonment point:
- Recovery expectation (retry, undo, support, quit):

---

### Hard Constraints
- Will not do:
- Will not tolerate:
- Absolute deal-breaker:

---

### Key Use Cases
1. Core use case (critical path)
2. Secondary scenario
3. Edge scenario

---

### Persona Quote
> “[What this persona would actually say when blocked]”

## Feature-to-Persona Mapping

| Feature | Persona 1 | Persona 2 | Persona 3 | Priority | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|------|
| Feature A | Critical / Useful / Unnecessary | | | High / Medium / Low / Cut | |
| Feature B | | | | | |
| Feature C | | | | | |

**Legend**
- **Critical**: Persona cannot succeed without it
- **Useful**: Improves experience but not required
- **Unnecessary**: Adds noise or friction

---

## Critical Features (Build First)

Features that unlock success for **all personas** or unblock a primary persona:

1. **[Feature Name]**
   - Persona(s):
   - Why it is critical:
   - Measurable impact:

2. **[Feature Name]**
   - Persona(s):
   - Why:
   - Impact:

---

## Nice-to-Have Features (Defer)

1. **[Feature Name]**
   - Persona(s):
   - Why it helps:
   - Why it can wait:

---

## Features to Cut (Do Not Build)

1. **[Feature Name]**
   - Why it fails personas:
   - Better alternative:

---

## User Journey Maps (Reality-Based)

### Persona 1 – Critical Path

Entry → First Action → Decision Point → Success / Failure
↓ ↓
Friction Drop-off


Steps:
1. …
2. …
3. …

---

### Persona 2 – Critical Path

Entry → Action → Outcome


---

### Persona 3 – Critical Path


Entry → Action → Outcome


---

## Validation Checklist (Non-Negotiable)

Before approving any feature or flow:

- [ ] Solves a real problem for at least one persona
- [ ] Persona(s) explicitly named
- [ ] Failure and recovery defined
- [ ] Smallest version identified
- [ ] Does not violate any hard constraint
- [ ] Device and context accounted for

---

## Review & Versioning

| Date | Change | Reason |
|------|------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | Initial creation | Project kickoff |

**Next Review Trigger**
- Major feature shift
- New target audience
- Platform expansion (mobile ↔ desktop)

---

**Operational Rule**  
If a design decision cannot be justified by this document, it must be reverted.
